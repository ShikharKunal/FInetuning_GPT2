# Question Answering Model using GPT-2

## Overview

This project is a Question Answering Model based on the GPT-2 language model by OpenAI. The model is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to explore, understand, and use for generating answers to user queries.

## Features

- **GPT-2 Model:** Utilizes the GPT-2 language model, known for its advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

- **Question Answering:** The notebook provides functionality for answering questions by interacting with the GPT-2 model.

- **Fine-tuning:** Users can fine-tune the model on their own datasets to enhance performance for specific domains.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/question-answering-gpt2.git
   cd question-answering-gpt2
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and install any required dependencies specified in the notebook.

3. **Download Pre-trained GPT-2 Model:**
   Download the pre-trained GPT-2 model weights from the official OpenAI repository as specified in the notebook.

4. **Run the Notebook:**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions provided. Execute the cells to load the model, fine-tune if necessary, and perform question answering.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook cells.

3. Execute the cells to load the GPT-2 model, fine-tune if needed, and generate answers to questions.
